# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

   This submission course project is meant to test our capacity to create a tidy data set. For that purpose, it is given to us some tasks that we must do. 
Create a run_analysis.R script which contains this:
1)	One data set with the files train and test merged.
2)	Extract the mean and the standard deviation of each measurement.
3)	Name the activities 
4)	Label the data set
5)	Create a tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
this project contains the following files:
-	A run_analysis.R script who can create all the above mentioned.
-	A code book to explain the variables and the transformations that have been made to them
-	A tidy.txt file who contains the tidy data set that must be created at point 5
