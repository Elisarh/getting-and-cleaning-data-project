Getting and Cleaning Data Project 

 Original Data
  The data set that it is used for this project is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset for Samsung. The raw data can be found in the original zipped data set file enclosed.

  Subject and Activity
The subjects are group of volunteers numbered from one to 30 and the activities that they do while are monitored: walking, walking upstairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing and laying.
At the original dataset also it is also include different types of measurements applied for everyone in all the activities.
One data set is created after reading all the files into data tables and merge them using the cbind command into the data set called Datas. Then, the mean and standard deviation are selected from the same data set.
All the variables are given a name and create a tidy data set with the average of all of them, named tidy.txt.
All the measurements in the data set have been normalized, so they do not have the units with them on the original file.
